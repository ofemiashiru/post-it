# Post-iT App

(Developer: Femi Ashiru)

[Live Project](https://ofemiashiru.github.io/post-it/)

This project was inteneded to help consolidate the things I have been learning within JavaScript. I wanted to attempt to see if I could take everything I have learned about using JavaScript to update the DOM to create a simple application. This application is a simple organiser that allows the users to add Post-iT notes to the screen and delete as they wish. The colours of the Post-iTs are randomised using Math.random() method to pick between 5 different classes. Give it a go and let me know what you think.
